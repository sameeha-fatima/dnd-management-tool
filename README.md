## Summary
DnD is a tabletop role-playing game, where Players come together to play in an imaginary world set by the DM (Dungeon Master). Often the DM has to plan a vast world consisting of Players (which consists of their class, race, job, stats, alignment, and attacks), NPCs (which have job, name, race), Monsters (which have their own types and attacks), and Towns (Name), which could take up a lot of time.

This tool is to help keep track of the initial world, so the tool doesnâ€™t track health, inventory, or other such things that can change. Instead, the purpose of our tool is to offer an easy way to keep track of the multiple components and attributes that are needed for an initial gaming session.

Our project will be a tool where the DungeonMaster can look up, add, and delete Players, Monsters, and NPCs within their created Session. The tool has the ability for the DungeonMaster to login to their account and view all the Sessions they are currently in charge of. The DungeonMaster can also create new Towns to use. 

The following are the tables and their relations to other tables:

DungeonMaster 1-to-Many with Session

Player Many to 1 and only 1 with Session
NPC Many to 1 and only 1 with Session
Monster Many to 1 and only 1 with Session

Town 1 to Many with Player
Town 1 to Many with NPC
